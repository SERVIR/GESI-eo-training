These materials were created to enhance the capability of the SERVIR Program to integrate Gender and Social Inclusion into their Earth science applications efforts. SERVIR is a NASA and USAID partnership that supports locally led efforts to strengthen climate resilience, food and water security, forest and carbon management, and air quality. These materials may be useful to other organizations who are interested in understanding the relationship between gender and social inclusion and environmental challenges.
